## Why OpenDicomViewer?

- **Free and open source** — MIT licensed, no restrictions on use or modification
- **Native macOS** — Built with SwiftUI and Metal, no Electron or web overhead
- **Fast** — Instant first-image display with background loading; images appear before the study finishes scanning
- **Multi-panel layouts** — Side-by-side, stacked, and quad views with synchronized scrolling and zoom
- **Clinical measurement tools** — Ruler, angle, and ROI statistics with real-time dashed preview lines
- **Designed for customization** — Clean, readable architecture that's easy to fork and adapt, including with AI coding assistants

## Features

- **Fast DICOM Parsing** — Pure-Swift parser with incremental scanning; first image displays instantly while the rest loads in the background
- **Multi-Panel Layouts** — Single, side-by-side, stacked, and quad arrangements with drag-and-drop series assignment
- **MPR & Volume Rendering** — One-click sagittal, coronal, and MIP views with adjustable slab thickness via Metal compute shaders
- **Window/Level** — Right-click drag, W/L tool, auto W/L, and ROI-based W/L with a live histogram overlay
- **Measurement Tools** — Ruler, angle, and ROI statistics with real-time preview lines
- **Synchronized Scrolling & Zoom** — Link panels to scroll to the same anatomical position using z-location matching
- **Cross-Reference Lines** — Overlay showing where other panels' slice planes intersect the current view
- **DICOM Tag Inspector** — Browse all metadata tags for the active image
- **Cursor Readout** — Real-time HU value and coordinates under the cursor
- **Scrollbar Thumbnails** — Hover the scrollbar to preview any slice
- **JPEG 2000 Support** — Compressed transfer syntaxes via DCMTK + OpenJPEG

## Quick Start

### For Users

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](../../releases), open it, and drag OpenDicomViewer to your Applications folder.

> The app is signed and notarized — it will open without any Gatekeeper warnings.

### For Developers

**Prerequisites:** macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma), Xcode 15+ (or Swift 5.9+ toolchain), Apple Silicon Mac (arm64).

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/jnheo-md/open-dicom-viewer.git
cd open-dicom-viewer

# Build release and package as .app bundle
./scripts/package_app.sh

# Install (optional)
cp -r OpenDicomViewer.app /Applications/
```

To run the test suite:

```bash
swift test
```

Pre-built static libraries for DCMTK and OpenJPEG are included in `libs/`. To rebuild them from source (e.g., for a different architecture):

```bash
./scripts/setup_native_deps.sh
```

A SwiftPM `.executableTarget` can't produce an installable iOS app bundle, so
the app is split into the `OpenDicomViewerCore` library target above (all the
actual UI/logic, cross-platform) plus a tiny per-platform executable/app
target. `OpenDicomViewerMacApp` is that shim for macOS; see
[`docs/iOS-Build.md`](docs/iOS-Build.md) for how an iOS Xcode App target wires
up to the same `OpenDicomViewerCore` product.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Dual Parser Strategy**: A fast pure-Swift parser (`SimpleDICOM.swift`) handles tag reading and metadata extraction during directory scanning, while the DCMTK wrapper handles pixel data decoding for complex transfer syntaxes.
- **Panel-Based Architecture**: Each panel (`PanelState`) owns its own image, W/L, zoom, and metadata state. The model (`DICOMModel`) manages shared resources (series data, caches, queues) and coordinates between panels.
- **Spatial Synchronization**: Linked scrolling uses physical z-location matching rather than proportional index matching, so panels showing different series display the same anatomical position.
- **NSView for Interaction**: Mouse gesture handling uses `NSViewRepresentable` wrapping a custom `NSView` subclass for reliable AppKit-level event handling (W/L drag, zoom, pan, annotations).

## Customization Guide

OpenDicomViewer is designed to be straightforward to customize — whether you're adding features manually or working with an AI coding assistant. Here's where to look for common changes:

| What you want to do | Where to look |
|---|---|
| **Add a new tool** | Define it in the `ActiveTool` enum in `PanelState.swift`, add mouse handling in `MultiPanelContainer.swift`, and add a button to the tool palette (also in `MultiPanelContainer.swift`) |
| **Add a keyboard shortcut** | Add an `.onKeyPress` handler in `ContentView.swift` |
| **Modify overlays** | Edit `AnnotationOverlay` or `InfoOverlay` in `MultiPanelContainer.swift` |
| **Change panel behavior** | Per-panel state lives in `PanelState.swift`; cross-panel coordination is in `DICOMModel.swift` |
| **Add a menu bar command** | Add commands in `OpenDicomViewerCoreApp.swift` |
| **Modify cross-reference lines** | Edit `CrossReferenceOverlay.swift` |

The codebase uses clear naming conventions and minimal abstraction layers, making it well-suited for AI-assisted development. Fork the project, describe what you want to change, and point your AI assistant at the relevant files above.
